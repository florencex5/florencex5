👀 Behind the "My Projects"
-
* **Projects 1 【Crude Oil ➔ EV ➔ Auto Industry】**
  * The summer of 2023 in New York, the sky ablaze with shades of orange. It was the spark of an idea that birthed this project series.
  * Series 2 just witnessed my maiden attempt at technical analysis. Hold the applause though, because, you know, no guarantees on the accuracy.Duh🥳
  * Hey there🤩 If you've stumbled upon these lines, chances are we share a common passion(E.g. Crude oil market, Electric vehicle, Hydrogen economy,etc.)So, handle my projects with care, won't you?
  * Well, that's a wrap for this project series. But, it's not a farewell; think of it more like the kickoff for my adventure into the realms of Crude Oil, Automakers, and the ever-pressing issue of Climate Change. Stick around; it's about to get interesting😝
