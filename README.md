👀 Behind the "My Project" -- Cracking the Climate-Conscious Hard Commodities Code
-
* The entire project? Built around the FCFF equation—because that’s where it all begins🤗
* Finally tested my own recommendations from [Series 1](https://github.com/florencex5/Crude_Oil_Finance_Project)✌️… loved the process only. Not the results. Why? Well, accuracy isn’t guaranteed ... again🤪(not my thing)
* My first LSTM adventure—let’s call it a solid start🤓
* Some Chapter 3 ideas might sound wild, but trust me, I’m not joking🧐
* Lastly🥹 this project took a piece of my life. No regrets—an unforgettable journey🥳


💡My Past Projects 【Crude Oil ➔ EV ➔ Auto Industry】
-
* [**Series 1: Crude Oil within the Context of Oligopoly Market**](https://github.com/florencex5/Crude_Oil_Finance_Project)👩🏻‍💻
  * Inspiration Source: Machine learning might be a solution for the unknown oligopoly market
  * Crude oil (oligopoly market) + automaker (cyclical company) + climate change (global issue) = **COLLABORATION**
* [**Series 2: Exploring the US Electric Vehicle(EV) Industry Through the US Bicycle Sharing Systems**](https://github.com/florencex5/EV_and_Bicycle)👩🏻‍💻
  * Inspiration Source: Bicycle Sharing System? EV? Are they similar? Are they different?
* [**Series 3: Collaborative Action Points for Auto Industry Sustainable Development**](https://github.com/florencex5/Crude_Oil_Finance_Project_2.git)👩🏻‍💻


👀 Behind the "My Project" -- Crude Oil ➔ EV ➔ Auto Industry
-
* The summer of 2023 in New York, the sky ablaze with shades of orange. It was the spark of an idea that birthed this project series.
* Series 2 just witnessed my maiden attempt at technical analysis. Hold the applause though, because, you know, no guarantees on the accuracy.Duh~😜
* Hey there😃 If you've stumbled upon these lines, chances are we share a common passion(E.g. Crude oil market, Electric vehicle, Hydrogen economy,etc.)So, handle my projects with care, won't you?


🌈 My Weekend:
-
**One** beam of sunshine☀️,

**Two** dancing brushes🖌️,

**Three** canvases🖼️ catching dreams,

**Four** pigments🎨 painting possibilities,

**Five** zesty kiwis🥝 for inspiration, and

... an infinite symphony of code🎹
